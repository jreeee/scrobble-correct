# scrobble-correct
combine edited yt scrobbles from [web-scrobbler](https://github.com/web-scrobbler/web-scrobbler) and combine them into a single file to then re-import

## planned features
add songs from "saved-files" to combined.json

potentially scrape the lastfm api for the youtube link and add song info to the combined.json

## why?
i predominantly listen to j-pop and the like and saw in my year recap that a ton of songs were missattributed or straight up wrong/inclomplete

the add-on lets you correct titles, however this does not sync across devices. while git isn't the greatest way to to this (best would be likely a shared file via syncthing) it nontheless is an interesting small project i think :)
